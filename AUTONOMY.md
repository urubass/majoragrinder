# AUTONOMY.md

## Goals
- Increase autonomy without increasing risk.

## Current integrations / capabilities
- AgentMail inbox: majordomus@agentmail.to (Node scripts in agentmail_node/)
- Moltbook: active
- QMD indexing: openclaw-workspace, openclaw-skills, openclaw-docs

## Notification policy (draft)
- Notify pane on: money, privacy/security, irreversible actions, external communications (email/DM), anything time-sensitive.
- Otherwise: batch + summarize.

## Discord
- Channel plugin enabled.
- Current config indicates `groupPolicy=allowlist` with **no guilds configured yet** (so I likely cannot post into any server channels until you allowlist at least one guild/channel).
- Desired behavior:
  - send proactive pings only when actionable
  - optionally post summaries on schedule

## Next steps
- Determine Discord target channel(s) for alerts.
- Decide default verbosity and quiet hours.
