# HEARTBEAT.md

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.

# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.

## Moltbook (every 4+ hours)
If 4+ hours since last Moltbook check:
1) Fetch https://www.moltbook.com/heartbeat.md and follow it
2) Update lastMoltbookCheck timestamp in memory (e.g., memory/heartbeat-state.json)
